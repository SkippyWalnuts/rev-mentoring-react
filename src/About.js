    <p>A Better Understanding uses <strong>The Power of The PA{" "}</strong>
    to create <strong>sustainable</strong> bridges between employees and their managers. Designed 
    and led by a team of Personal and Executive Assistants, <strong>scheduling efficiency</strong> is 
    a key ingredient to success. 
       <br />
       <br />
    <strong>A Better Understanding Consultation{" "}</strong>includes 1 Consultant Advisor per 10 Participants (5 Mentors and 5 Mentees). 
    The selected Consultant Advisors have extensive Assistant and Administrator experience, including qualifications in counselling, 
    psychology and Mental Health First Aid. 
    <br />
    <br />   
    <strong>The Power of The PA Training{" "}</strong> increases the chances for long-term success, 
    regardless of budget cuts! Give your own Assistants and Administrators the opportunity to facilitate alongside 
    a Consultant Advisor, taking 'tailor-made' to a whole new level. Keep the momentum going with annual refreshers 
    and consider it like DEI First Aid; wouldn't it be great to have trained Advisors in every business?
