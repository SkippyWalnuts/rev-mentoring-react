    <p>A Better Understanding uses <strong>The Power of The PA{" "}</strong>
    to create <strong>sustainable</strong> bridges between employees and their managers. Designed 
    and led by a team of Personal and Executive Assistants, <strong>scheduling efficiency</strong> is 
    key to success. 
       <br />
       <br />
    <strong>A Better Understanding Consultation{" "}</strong>includes:
    <br />
    <ul>
    <li>1 x Consultant Advisor</li>
     <li>5 Mentors - 5 Mentees</li>
    </ul>
    
    Our Consultant Advisors have extensive Assistant and Administrator experience, including qualifications in 
    counselling, psychology and Mental Health First Aid. Each Advisor brings their own 
    perspective during group discussions, aids in matching Mentors to Mentees, and can 
    speak confidently with participants, regardless of seniority. 
    <br />
    <br />   
    <strong>The Power of The PA Training{" "}</strong> increases the chances for long-term success, 
    regardless of budget cuts! Give your own Assistants and Administrators the opportunity to facilitate alongside 
    a Consultant Advisor, taking 'tailor-made' to a whole new level. Keep the momentum going with annual refreshers 
    and consider it like DEI First Aid; wouldn't it be great to have trained Advisors in every business?
